Ls like C implementation 

Used threads to make it harder for me, trying to get my head around them and how to pass arguments while using them
Dynamic allocation used as well

## Compile 
- gcc -o lsc lsc.c -lpthread. 

TODO: 
-  Add better formatting and figure out how to print colors when listing for diference between dirs and regular files 
-  Add more functionalities
