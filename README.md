# UnixLikeC
My target is to create my own C implementation of various Unix like commands.

One of my main goals is to learn and get comfortable using C instructions as threads and forks, as well as getting more into Unix distros.

My approach for this commands is to understand what they do and try to replicate them, at least on a basic level and not with all the functions but my own implementation without looking other's implementations.

Some commands like 'locate' might not be implemented as this command relies on a DB which stores all the files.
