# Tail C like implementation 

Tail allows you to read last 10 lines of any file (by default) - number of lines can be modified with flag '-n'. 

A challenge I will do my best to implement is '-F' option, as this allows you to keep reading into a file on "real-time" till user manually stops it with CTRL + C.
